# Global Population Insights

Welcome to the Global Population Insights repository! This project provides an in-depth analysis of global population growth, trends, and policies. It includes interactive data visualizations and detailed content to help understand the implications of a rapidly expanding global population.

## Project Overview

The world’s population is growing at an unprecedented rate, and understanding the dynamics of this growth is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. This project aims to present comprehensive data and insights on population growth from 1960 to 2021, with projections for the future, presented as an interactive slideshow.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Using Plotly.js, we provide dynamic charts (bar, treemap, line) that allow users to explore population data in depth.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Each slide offers a thorough analysis of various aspects of population growth, including regional trends, income group disparities, the impact on natural resources, and case studies.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Based on the data, the presentation suggests actionable policy recommendations to address the challenges posed by rapid population growth.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and accessible on various devices.
- **Deep Linking**: Navigate directly to specific slides using URL hashes.
