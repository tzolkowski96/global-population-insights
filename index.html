                <h1>Our World at 8 Billion</h1>
                <p><strong>Welcome to the human story behind the numbers.</strong></p>
                <p>In late 2022, our global family reached a historic milestone: 8 billion people. But this isn't just about a big number. It's about how we live, how we grow, and how we share our planet.</p>
                <p>This project takes you on a journey through the data—from the past 60 years to the future ahead—to understand what this growth means for all of us.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="slide2" class="slide">
                <h2>A Snapshot of Our Growing World</h2>
                <p>Imagine a room with 8 billion people. That's us right now. And by 2030, we're expected to add another billion.</p>
                <p>This rapid growth brings both challenges and opportunities. More people means more brilliant minds to solve problems, but it also means we need to be smarter about how we use Earth's resources.</p>
                <blockquote><p>“The delicate balance between our growing global family and Earth's finite resources calls for careful planning and fair strategies for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
                <p>In this brief, we'll look beyond the charts. We'll explore the stories of the most populous nations, see how education shapes families, and discuss ideas that can help us build a sustainable future. It's not just data; it's a conversation about our shared home.</p>

                <h2>What Lies Ahead?</h2>
                <p>So, where are we heading? Experts predict that while we are still growing, the <em>pace</em> is changing. We likely passed the 8 billion mark in 2023, but the growth isn't happening everywhere at once.</p>
                <p>A huge portion of humanity lives in just a handful of countries. You might know the big ones: <strong>China</strong> and <strong>India</strong>. For decades, China was the most populous, but India is taking the lead. This shift isn't just a statistic—it changes the global economy, culture, and geopolitics.</p>
                <p>We're also seeing a tale of two eras: the rapid growth of the late 20th century versus the slower, more complex trends of today. Factors like better healthcare and education are reshaping how our global family grows.</p>

                <h2>Rich, Poor, and Growing: The Income Gap</h2>
                <div id="income-group-chart" class="chart-container-loading" aria-label="Bar chart showing Population Growth Rates by Income Group (CAGR %)"></div>
                <p>Does money change how fast a population grows? The data says yes. The chart above shows the "speed limit" of growth for different income groups.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Middle-income countries are growing the fastest. Why? It's often a "sweet spot" where healthcare is improving—saving more lives—but family sizes haven't shrunk yet. In contrast, wealthier nations tend to grow slower as education and career opportunities lead to smaller families. Understanding this helps us tailor support where it's needed most.</p>

                <p>Let's zoom out to the continents. This colorful map isn't just shapes; it shows where the human story is unfolding.</p>
                <p><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> is seeing the most vibrant growth, driven by a young, dynamic population. Meanwhile, regions like <strong>North America</strong> and <strong>Europe</strong> are growing much more slowly. This shift means the future of the global workforce and innovation will increasingly come from the Global South.</p>

                <h2>Behind the Scenes: How This Works</h2>
                <p>Curious about the magic behind this website? It's built with three simple but powerful tools, like the bricks, paint, and electricity of a house:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML (The Skeleton):</strong> This gives the website its structure—the headlines, paragraphs, and sections you're reading right now.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS (The Style):</strong> This makes it look good. It handles the colors, fonts, and the layout that lets you scroll smoothly through the story.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript (The Brains):</strong> This adds the interactivity. It powers the charts that move when you hover over them and highlights the menu as you scroll.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We also use a special tool called <strong>Plotly.js</strong> to draw the colorful charts. It takes raw numbers and turns them into the pictures that make the data easy to understand.</p>
